M is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American cultural icon. As the nominal foreman of the paternally eponymous family, M and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. M embodies many American working class stereotypes: he is obese, immature, outspoken, aggressive, balding, ignorant, unprofessional, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he is fundamentally a good man and is staunchly protective of his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President George H. W. Bush, and winning a Grammy Award as a member of a barbershop quartet. he works as the nuclear safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant (in Sector 7-G). At the nuclear plant, M is often ignored and completely forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and he constantly falls asleep and neglects his duties. M personality is frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity, laziness and his explosive anger. He has a low intelligence levels. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. M will often strangle Bart on impulse upon Bart angering him (and can also be seen saying one of his catchphrases, "Why you littleâ€”!") in a cartoonish manner.
